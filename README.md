#### TIP
If all you want to do is to move the player to a specific block, then you 
can safely ignore most of these parameters and simply send these values:

```
x * 16, y * 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false, false, 0
```

This will move the player to the block located at the `x` by `y` position.
The other parameters are only useful for more advanced movement code.
